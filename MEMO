Why that name?
This is a personal homage to C.S. Lewis' work that I discovered at a young age and still enjoy to this day.
Dawn Treader is an infrastructure journey - a ship built to carry an application from familiar shores into open waters.
What begins as a local experiment becomes a living Kubernetes cluster, navigated by Helm charts and GitOps maps, crewed by automation, and guided steadily toward the cloud.
This project explores how modern platforms are not just deployed, but sailed: deliberately, declaratively, and with curiosity for what lies beyond the horizon, in the hopes to find Aslan's country.
